Ants learn to find 2 points thanks to their pheromones.

At first the ants make random movements. And leave a mark behind them. We save the 5 boxes behind the saddle.

As soon as they find a reward, we score the tracks, boxes behind it.

If another ants finds a route scored, it in turn scores its route.
